# Accessibility report for Spydle

## 1. Principles of Universal Design

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
The game interface is accessible to users regardless of age or ability, with straightforward navigation options like "Create Room," "Join," and "View All Rooms." Buttons change color when hovered over, making it clear which one to select. The simple layout ensures everyone can participate equally. Future enhancements could include text-to-speech functionality, such as reading aloud substrings displayed on the screen.

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Players can choose between creating a room, joining an existing room, or viewing all available rooms, allowing flexibility in participation.  
**Future Features:** Adding language options or difficulty levels could cater to a diverse range of players, including younger users or non-native speakers. Night mode and light mode could also accommodate users with varying light sensitivity.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The interface employs clear labels and intuitive buttons, such as "Join," "Create Room," and "Start Game," making navigation straightforward even for first-time users. Text boxes are labeled with purposes like "Enter your nickname" and "Enter existing room code." Currently, the README on GitHub is the primary way to understand the game; adding a user manual and in-game information view could improve accessibility.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
The timer, room code, and turn indicator are prominently displayed, ensuring critical information is easy to perceive. Timers are distinguished by labels like "Game Timer" and "Turn in..."  
**Future Features:** Incorporating auditory or vibration feedback for timer expiration or incorrect input could assist users with sensory preferences. Screen reader support and audible information for substrings could further enhance accessibility.

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
The program allows players to cancel actions, such as exiting the room creation process, minimizing the consequences of accidental clicks. Players can also retry incorrect words during their turns without penalties until the timer expires.

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
The game requires minimal physical interaction, as most actions involve clicking buttons or typing words. Users can submit words through either the "Submit" button or the Enter key.  
**Future Features:** Adding keyboard shortcuts or voice input could make the game even more accessible for users with mobility challenges.

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
**Future Features:** Future Features: Optimizing the layout for smaller screens and adding responsive design features would improve usability on mobile devices, or larger screens, such as ultrawide monitors.  This would include touch-friendly navigation, scalable assets for high-resolution displays, and support for both portrait and landscape modes. Additional features like pinch-to-zoom and compact mode will improve accessibility and ensure an optimized experience for all users, particularly people with visual impairments.

## 2. Who would we market our program towards?
Spydle is ideal for individuals who enjoy interactive, word-based games that challenge their vocabulary and quick thinking, particularly in social settings. It is perfect for groups of friends seeking a fun and competitive activity during game nights, thanks to its short duration and support for multiple players. Additionally, the game could target educators or parents looking for engaging tools to help students expand their vocabulary and spelling skills. Spydle's fast-paced, turn-based design rewards creativity and longer words, making it appealing to younger players who enjoy challenges and need encouragement.

## 3. Accessibility Considerations: who is less likely to be used by certain demographics?
Spydle may be less likely to attract certain demographics, such as individuals with limited access to technology or internet connectivity, as it relies on a digital platform. Players with disabilities, such as visual impairments or motor challenges, may encounter difficulties due to the lack of screen reader support or alternative input methods. Language barriers could discourage non-native speakers, as the game requires English proficiency for identifying and spelling words.  
Addressing these exclusions ethically would involve integrating multilingual support, assistive technologies, and an offline version of the game. These features would promote inclusivity and broaden the program's appeal across diverse demographics.
